## Smart Home Energy Monitoring System
**Author**: Aditya Sabnis  
**Date**: April 11, 2025  
**Submission**: Real-time simulation of energy usage, local storage, and cloud dashboard  
**Tools**: Python, Flask, SQLite/CSV, FreeRTOS-style task scheduling

---

## Project Objective
To build a simulated smart embedded system that:

- Monitors energy usage of 3 appliances  
- Stores data locally  
- Sends data to a cloud server  
- Visualizes real-time energy statistics  

---

## Overview
This project simulates a **Smart Home Energy Monitoring System** using Python for embedded-like simulation and a Flask server for data visualization. Sensor readings are randomly generated (no physical ESP device is used). Data is logged locally and published via simulated MQTT to a server that stores, analyzes, and displays energy usage per device.

## System Components

### 1. Embedded Simulation
- **main.py**: Generates random power values for devices and sends data to server.
- **local_storage.py**: Logs data in `sensor_log.csv` for traceability.
- **mqtt_client.py**: Mimics MQTT behavior by sending POST requests to Flask server.
- **utils.py**: Generates device IDs, timestamps, and simulated power values.

### 2. Server & Visualization
- **server.py**: Flask server that receives POST data on `/energy`, stores in memory, and renders an HTML dashboard on `/dashboard`.
- **dashboard.html**: Renders a table of average, max, and min power usage by device.

### 3. Logs & Documentation
- **sensor_log.csv**: CSV log file of each generated reading.
- **comm_log.txt**: Logs all communication and errors.
- **schema.png**: System flowchart.
- **architecture.pdf/png**: High-level architecture diagram.

---

## Data Flow Summary

1. `main.py` generates synthetic readings per device every few seconds.
2. Each reading is:
   - Logged locally in `sensor_log.csv`
   - Sent via simulated MQTT (HTTP POST) to Flask server
3. Server receives and stores data in memory.
4. Visiting `/dashboard` shows aggregated power usage per device.

## How to Run

### Step 1: Start the Flask Server
```bash
cd server
python server.py
```
Visit: [http://localhost:5000/dashboard](http://localhost:5000/dashboard)

### Step 2: Simulate Sensor Data
Open a new terminal:
```bash
cd embedded
python main.py
```
You will see periodic readings being sent to the server and logged locally.
